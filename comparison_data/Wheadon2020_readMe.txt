This is a sample of the local judging data from one school, following the same pupils over 5 years, as described in A comparative judgement approach to the large-scale assessment of primary writing in England, (Wheadon et al, 2020).

id: unique decision id
timeTaken: time taken in milliseconds
createdAt: time date of decision
judgeId: unique judge id
chosen: six letter code for the chosen person
notChosen: six letter code for the not chosen person
task: name of the task
person_chosen: id of the person chosen
person_not_chosen: id of the person not chosen

The person_chosen and the person_not_chosen are ids that are consistent across all tasks. The person_chosen is the person that was chosen by the judge and the person_not_chosen is the person that was not chosen by the judge.
