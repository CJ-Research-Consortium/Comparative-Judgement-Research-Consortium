Guidance and support are available for researchers wishing to use comparative judgement.

A journal article focussed on education researchers but also of wider usefulness is [Jones and Davies (2024) Comparative judgement in education research](https://doi.org/10.1080/1743727X.2023.2242273).

Another article focussed on applied linguistics but again of wider interest is [Thwaites and Paquot (2024) Comparative judgement for advancing research in applied linguistics][here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rmal.2024.100142).

Ian Jones has produced a [user guide](https://nmm.notion.site/No-More-Marking-for-researchers-70cb4eec46d547cd91c65ff2066d415f) specific to the popular and free-to-use platform [No More Marking](https://www.nomoremarking.com/).

CJRC consortium founders Ian, Marie and Rowland are also currently working on a methods book for CJ researchers. Watch this space!
